                        <h2>About</h2>
                        <p>
                            Hello! My name is Ethan Graupmann. I'm a software and game developer based in Colorado. I have a bunch of personal projects ranging from
                            big RPG games to smaller mods for games I enjoy. I also continue to develop my skills in Python, Java, C# and C++, and front-end development.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I'm not focused on my passions in coding and development, I'm often spending time with my family in Colorado, or working as a Lifeguard
                            in-state.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            My passion comes from telling stories and achievement. Software Development is a process- And in that process, I find a satisfaction in
                            learning and growing- Moreover, the sensation of completing a project or feature is one of great satisfaction for me! Game Development and
                            design is another passion of mine- I see game design as the art of telling stories and creating art in a medium that allows the audience to
                            interact directly with it, and RPGs in particular give the audience a new perspective, through the eyes of the characters.

                    While most of my educational experience covered the basics of coding and prepared me for understanding coding languages, I have since applied that 
                    knowledge to a wide variety of codes; I work primarily in Java, Python, and C++ to develop a general understanding of all code languages, but also
                    keep my skills sharp in R, C#, HTML, Java/Typescript, and more.

                            Believe it or not, but the page you're visiting right now is all coded by me- Most of it is done in HTML, but there are aspects of JavaScript and CSS
                            implemented for features and appearance.

                            The following is a design of a website for making Pizza Orders- The submissions don't go anywhere in the website, but the website istels is 
                            just a demonstration of some of my skills in HTML. This was a project I was working on in the process of compleeting a coding certification 
                            for HTML and CSS.

                            minor updates to this one, as it's pretty much complete- And I've moved onto other, bigger projects.

                        Much of my game development experience comes from personal projects that I am continuously improving on - From full, standalone games to mods
                        that build off of existing games. I enjoy dipping my hands into all aspects of game design- From art, to coding, to balancing and worldbuilding!
                        These are a couple of examples of my work in game development and design;

                            My largest (And still undergoing) personal project, this is a Turn-Based, Fantasy RPG created using RPG Maker. Although the game itself is
                            created mainly using the events in the engine, I've had to develop several script-based events and use a few add-ons as well! The coding is
                            done in JavaScript, and all of the work in this game is my own- Art, Character development, Combat, and More!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I have a personal goal to make this game all on my own, no matter how long it takes- And I plan on getting into every part of it, from music
                            to animation. During the fist few months of working on the beginning, I've gotten over 50 downloads in it!

                            I've created a unique species mod for the game Starbound (A Terraria-Style game in a Sci-Fi setting), snake-like humanoids called the Ryophi.
                            The mod for Starbound is public on the Steam Workshop, and has over 400 users! Starbound, and by extension the mod, is written in JavaScript,
                            and uses JSON objects.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            While some of the mod's work was in sprites, I've also programmed the species to be unique- A larger hitbox, unique particles around their
                            models, and unique text for item descriptions! The Ryophi are also planned to be more fleshed-out lore-wise in the future, as I've created
                            a page on <a href="https://toyhou.se/23110595.ryophi">Toyhouse</a> for them.
